If you do so, the creator is not responsible for anything. However, this project presents the idea that how we can use ML/DL in health care if developed at large scale and with authentic and verified data.

## How to use üíª
- Enter the Symptoms and get the predicted disease and description with recommended precautions, medications,diets and workouts.

## How to run locally üõ†Ô∏è
- Before the following steps make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/download), [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your system
- Clone the complete project with or you can just download the code and unzip it
  ```
  ‚ùØ git clone -b deploy https://github.com/bhoomikamittal8/Health_Hive.git
  ```
- Once the project is cloned, open anaconda prompt in the directory where the project was cloned and paste the following block
  ```
  conda create -n Health_Hive python=3.6.12
  conda activate Health_Hive
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
only you have to activate it everytime you open new terminal or reopen project after exit.
- Activate venv (virtual environment)
    ```
    conda activate Health_Hive
    ```
- And finally run the project with
  ```
  python main.py
  ```
- Open the localhost url provided after running `main.py` and now you can use the project locally in your web browser.

## Further Improvements üìà
This was my Practice Project so there are lot of things to improve upon

- CSS code is totally messed up :pensive: (some code in file and some inline)
- Frontend can be made more nicer (PS: I suck at frontend development) :cry:	
- More data can be collected manually via web scrapping to make the system more accurate :monocle_face:	
- Modularized code can be written instead of writing in Jupyter Notebooks (will follow this in upcoming projects)
